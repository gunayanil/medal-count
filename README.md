# Medal Count Mini App

Bare minimum tests and accessibility improvements implemented.

### If I had more time

- I would improve table accessibility and add more tests, especially for UI interactions
- I would also polish the UI further (didn't spend much time on CSS)

### Notes

- Started around 10:30 am and finished at 1:30 pm
- CSS sprite handling took a bit of time, I'm still not 100% confident in the backgorund position logic

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Test

```bash
npm run test
```
